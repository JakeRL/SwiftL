# SwiftL
My first Swfit project! SwiftL is a small and simple app that uses the Chicago Public Transit API to show the next arrival times for the train line and train station of your choosing.

This is the first app that I've developed using Swift. With that being said, I'm sure that there are areas that I could improve on and I would love to hear feedback as to where those areas are. As of now, this project is mostly a learning experience, but in the future I would love to devote time to build more robust functionality as well as a beautiful and intuitive UI/UX.
